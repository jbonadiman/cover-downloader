# cover-downloader

This is a CLI program that automatically downloads missing covers from your PCSX2 installation.
It was heavily based off [PS2CoverDL](https://github.com/xlenore/ps2-covers) and in fact, I'm using its giant covers repo as the covers' source.
I worked on this to focus on cross-compatibility and performance. You could run this even in a Xbox Series S/X ðŸ˜Š

## usage
cover-downloader -p/--path <_folder that contains /covers, /cache/gamelist.cache_>
